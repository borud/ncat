# ncat

Quick debug utility for logging GPS data on Teletonica RutX09. Should work for any scenario where you have a GPS attached as a serial device.

## Build

```shell
make
```

This will produce `bin/ncat` or `bin/ncat.exe` (whichever is the correct for your OS) and `bin/ncat-arm`, which will run on RutX09 or RPi.
